However, this isnâ€™t enough to know who lives there and how. Therefore, we decided to add some useful features, when available, like density, poverty, literacy rate, GDP per capita, GINI index, rural population, population living in a city of more than 1 million inhabitants, unemployment rate, life expectancy, fertility rate and distribution of the population in 3 segments (children, labor force, elder people). This enable us to know more about the status of each country : for example China may be a highy populated country as India but the difference is that India is a younger country.')

    st.markdown('_The goal of this tool is to be able to learn more about the status of the 7 billion people living on earth. This tool tries to describe where and how people are living. The living conditions are described by life expectancy, density, etc. However, some data must be approached carefully: most of the values are calculated according to international standards but some may not reflect the entire reality. For example, GDP per capita is not a real measure of the wealth distribution. But, when confronted to other indicators it helps understand the actual distribution._')
